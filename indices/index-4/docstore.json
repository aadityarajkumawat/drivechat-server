Operating systems supported Linux are known as Linux distributions or Linux Distros. Examples include Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Gentoo, Arch Linux, and lots of others. Each of these Linux Distros also have their own variants where one provides better user-experience over others taking full advantage of existing OS and building on top of that. \n\nThe Linux kernel has been under active development since 1991, and has proven to be extremely versatile and adaptable. you'll find computers that run Linux in a wide variety of contexts all over the world, from web servers to cell phones. Today, 90% of all cloud infrastructure and 74% of the world\u2019s smartphones are powered by Linux. This is because of great security and efficient management of resources done by the OS.\n\nHowever, new comers to Linux may find it somewhat difficult to approach, as Linux file systems have a special structure than those found on Windows or MacOS. Additionally, Linux-based operating systems depend heavily on working with the instruction interface, while most personal computers depend on graphical interfaces.\n\nThis guide is an introduction to important command line concepts and skills and equips newcomers to learn more about Linux.\n\nToday Linux has joined the desktop market. Linux developers concentrated on networking and services in the beginning, and office applications have been the last barrier to be taken down. We don't like to admit that Microsoft is ruling this market, so plenty of alternatives have been started over the last couple of years to make Linux an acceptable choice as a workstation, providing an easy user interface and MS compatible office applications like word processors, spreadsheets, presentations and the like.\n\nOn the server side, Linux is well-known as a stable and reliable platform, providing database and trading services for companies like Amazon, the well-known online bookshop, US Post Office, the German army and many others. Especially Internet providers and Internet service providers have grown fond of Linux as firewall, proxy- and web server, and you will find a Linux box within reach of every UNIX system administrator who appreciates a comfortable management station.\n\nClusters of Linux machines are used in the creation of movies such as \"Titanic\", \"Shrek\" and others. In post offices, they are the nerve centers that route mail and in large search engine, clusters are used to perform internet searches.These are only a few of the thousands of heavy-duty jobs that Linux is performing day-to-day across the world. It is also worth to note that modern Linux not only runs on workstations, mid- and high-end servers, but also on \"gadgets\" like PDA's, mobiles, a shipload of embedded applications and even on experimental wristwatches. This makes Linux the only operating system in the world covering such a wide range of hardware.\n\nOpen Source nature of Linux\n\nThe idea behind Open Source software is rather simple: when programmers can read, distribute  and alter code, the code will mature. People can adapt it, fix it, debug it,  and that they  can do it at a speed that dwarfs the performance of software developers at conventional companies. This software  are going to be  more flexible and of a better quality than software that has been developed using  the traditional  channels, because more people have tested it  in additional  different conditions than the closed software developer ever can.\n\nThe Open Source initiative  began to  make this clear to the commercial world,  and really  slowly, commercial vendors are  beginning to  see the point. While  plenty of  academics and technical people have already been convinced for 20 years now that  this is often  the way to go, commercial vendors needed applications  just like the Internet  to form  them realize they can profit from Open Source.

Now Linux has grown past the stage where it was almost exclusively  a tutorial  system, useful only to  a couple  of people with a technical background.\n\nNow Linux provides  quite  the operating system: there is an entire infrastructure supporting the chain of effort  of making  an operating system,  of creating  and testing programs for it, of bringing everything to the users, of supplying maintenance, updates and support and customizations, etcetera. Today, Linux  is prepared  to accept the challenge of a fast-changing world.\n\nAdvantages of Linux\n\nA lot of the advantages of Linux are a consequence of Linux' origins, deeply rooted in UNIX,  apart from  the first advantage, of course: \n\n1.    Linux is free:\nAs in free beer, they say. If  you would like  to spend absolutely nothing,  you do not  even have to pay the price of a CD. Linux  are often  downloaded in its entirety from the Internet completely for free. No registration fees, no costs per user, free updates, and freely available  ASCII text file  in case you want to change the behavior of your system.\n\nMost of all, Linux is free as in free speech:\n\nThe license commonly used  is that the  GNU Public License (GPL). The license says that anybody who may want to do so, has  the proper  to change Linux and eventually to redistribute a changed version, on the one condition that the code  remains  available after redistribution. In practice,  you're  free to grab a kernel image,  as an example  to add support for teletransportation machines or time travel and sell your new code, as long as your customers can still have  a replica  of that code.\n\n2.    Linux is portable to any hardware platform:\nA vendor who wants to sell  a replacement  type of computer and who doesn't know what kind of OS his new machine will run (say the CPU in your car or washing machine), can take a Linux kernel and make it work on his hardware, because documentation  associated with  this activity is freely available.\n\nDisadvantages of Linux\n\n1.    There are far too many different distributions:\n\n\"Quot capites, tot rationes\", as the Romans already said: the more people, the more opinions. At first glance, the amount of Linux distributions can be frightening, or ridiculous, depending on your point of view. But it also means that everyone will find what he or she needs. You don't need to be an expert to find a suitable release. \n\nWhen asked, generally every Linux user will say that the best distribution is the specific version he is using. So which one should you choose? Don't worry too much about that: all releases contain more or less the same set of basic packages. On top of the basics, special third party software is added making, for example, TurboLinux more suitable for the small and medium enterprise, RedHat for servers and SuSE for workstations. However, the differences are likely to be very superficial. The best strategy is to test a couple of distributions; unfortunately not everybody has the time for this. Luckily, there is plenty of advice on the subject of choosing your Linux. A quick search on Google, using the keywords \"choosing your distribution\" brings up tens of links to good advise. The Installation HOWTO also discusses choosing your distribution.\n\n2.     Linux is not very user friendly and confusing for beginners:\n\nIt must be said that Linux, at least the core system, is less userfriendly to use than MS Windows and certainly more difficult than MacOS, but... In light of its popularity, considerable effort has been made to make Linux even easier to use, especially for new users. More information is being released.\n\nStructure of Linux\n\nThe architecture of linux can be generalized in the following structure.\n\nKernel: Kernel is the core of the Linux based operating system. It virtualizes the common hardware resources of the computer to provide each process with its virtual resources. This makes the process seem as if it is the sole process running on the machine. The kernel", "start_char_idx": 4149, "end_char_idx": 8198, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee83c810-b884-47b7-a808-7af5e7d9d67a": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee83c810-b884-47b7-a808-7af5e7d9d67a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4ddb5115-9a6a-4aed-a154-0bd84c42569d", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "37af8e34d7279788202c2a7d403fcb0c596367d7a2a3534cb89d80c9cb2b3786"}, "2": {"node_id": "122b79a0-d4cb-4791-8bdb-4e1ece55d407", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3848e65e4655fe896db1c725f0f5a78e62a25723b4558d350deef29d8f825d85"}}, "hash": "0b13fd12efa5a056a9fd765ac09b368c4738ad51151786bcf90a0f27148df3dc", "text": "This makes the process seem as if it is the sole process running on the machine. The kernel is also responsible for preventing and mitigating conflicts between different processes. Different types of the kernel are:\n Monolithic Kernel\n Hybrid kernels\n Exo kernels\n Micro kernels\n System Library: Is the special types of functions that are used to implement the functionality of the operating system.\n Shell: It is an interface to the kernel which hides the complexity of the kernel\u2019s functions from the users. It takes commands from the user and executes the kernel\u2019s functions.\n Hardware Layer: This layer consists all peripheral devices like RAM/ HDD/ CPU etc.\n  System Utility: It provides the functionalities of an operating system to the user.\n\nLinux File System\nA Linux file system is a structured collection of files on a disk drive or a partition. A partition is a segment of memory and contains some specific data. In our machine, there can be various partitions of the memory. Generally, every partition contains a file system.\n\nThe general-purpose computer system needs to store data systematically so that we can easily access the files in less time. It stores the data on hard disks (HDD) or some equivalent storage type. There may be below reasons for maintaining the file system:\n\nPrimarily the computer saves data to the RAM storage; it may lose the data if it gets turned off. However, there is non-volatile RAM (Flash RAM and SSD) that is available to maintain the data after the power interruption.\nData storage is preferred on hard drives as compared to standard RAM as RAM costs more than disk space. The hard disks costs are dropping gradually comparatively the RAM.\nThe Linux file system contains the following sections:\n\nThe root directory (/)\nA specific data storage format (EXT3, EXT4, BTRFS, XFS and so on)\nA partition or logical volume having a particular file system.\n\nLinux File System Features\nIn Linux, the file system creates a tree structure. All the files are arranged as a tree and its branches. The topmost directory called the root (/) directory. All other directories in Linux can be accessed from the root directory.\n\nSome key features of Linux file system are as following:\n\nSpecifying paths: Linux does not use the backslash (\\) to separate the components; it uses forward slash (/) as an alternative. For example, as in Windows, the data may be stored in C:\\ My Documents\\ Work, whereas, in Linux, it would be stored in /home/ My Document/ Work.\n\nParition, Directories, and Drives: Linux does not use drive letters to organize the drive as Windows does. In Linux, we cannot tell whether we are addressing a partition, a network device, or an \"ordinary\" directory and a Drive.\nCase Sensitivity: Linux file system is case sensitive. It distinguishes between lowercase and uppercase file names. Such as, there is a difference between test.txt and Test.txt in Linux. This rule is also applied for directories and Linux commands.\n\nFile Extensions: In Linux, a file may have the extension '.txt,' but it is not necessary that a file should have a file extension. While working with Shell, it creates some problems for the beginners to differentiate between files and directories. If we use the graphical file manager, it symbolizes the files and folders.\n\nHidden files: Linux distinguishes between standard files and hidden files, mostly the configuration files are hidden in Linux OS. Usually, we don't need to access or read the hidden files. The hidden files in Linux are represented by a dot (.) before the file name (e.g., .ignore). To access the files, we need to change the view in the file manager or need to use a specific command in the shell.", "start_char_idx": 8180, "end_char_idx": 11870, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"4ddb5115-9a6a-4aed-a154-0bd84c42569d": {"node_ids": ["88515c3a-0543-45e5-bf72-4e905865548a", "122b79a0-d4cb-4791-8bdb-4e1ece55d407", "ee83c810-b884-47b7-a808-7af5e7d9d67a"], "metadata": {}}}}
