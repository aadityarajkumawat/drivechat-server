lead \nthe market and acquire the most innovative and promising AI \nbusinesses.\n17\n18\n19\n20https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoXp1leA5QcGoogle announced their Duplex system, a new technology for \nconducting natural conversations to carry out \u201creal world\u201d tasks over \nthe phone. \nThe technology is directed towards completing specific tasks, such \nas scheduling certain types of appointments. \nFor such tasks, the system makes the conversational experience as \nnatural as possible, allowing people to speak normally, like they \nwould to another person, without having to adapt to a machine.\n21\n22\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsUV0mGEGaY23\n24\n25The answer is all of the above. \nEach of these highly realistic images were created by generative \nadversarial networks, or GANs.\nGAN, a concept introduced by Google researcher Ian Goodfellow in \n2014, taps into the idea of \u201cAI versus AI.\u201d \nThere are two neural networks: the generator, which comes up \nwith a fake image (say a dog for instance), and a discriminator, \nwhich compares the result to real -world images and gives feedback \nto the generator on how close it is to replicating a realistic image.26\n27\n28\n29The Turing Test\nTuring test\nA test to determine whether a computer has achieved intelligence\nAlan Turing\nAn English mathematician who wrote a landmark paper in 1950 that \nasked the question: Can machines think?\nHe proposed a test to answer the question \"How will we know when \nwe have succeeded?\u201c\nHe said that a machine passes the test when it successfully generates \nresponses appropriate enough to convince the evaluator that it is \nhuman.30\nIn the Turing test, the interrogator must determine which \nrespondent is the computer and which is the human.31THE LOEBNER PRIZE FOR COMPLETING THE TURING TEST\nTheLoebner Prize is an annual competition in artificial \nintelligence that awards prizes to the computer \nprograms considered by the judges to be the most human -\nlike, using the Turing Test computer and person arrangement.\nThe contest was launched in 1990 by Hugh Loebner and there \nare bronze, silver, and gold coin prizes, plus money .\n\u2022So far, there have only been winners of the bronze medal and a \n$4,000 award. 32\nSilver \u2013a one -time-only prize plus $25,000 offered for the first program \nthat judges cannot distinguish from a real human.\nGold plus $100,000 for the first program that judges cannot distinguish from \na real human in a Turing test that includes deciphering and understanding \ntext, visual, and auditory input. \nOnce this is achieved, the annual competition will end. \n.33KNOWLEDGE REPRESENTATION\n\u2022We need to create a logical view of the data, based on how we want \nto process

To reach this huge \ntarget, a developing fetus must create around 250,000 neurons per \nminute !\nEach neuron is connected to at least 10,000 others \u2013giving well over \n1,000 trillion connections (1 quadrillion connections) .\nThey all connect at a junction called a synapse, which can be electrical or a \nhigher percentage of them are chemical. 51Incoming signals to the neuron can be either excitatory \u2013which means they \ntend to make the neuron fire(generate an electrical impulse) \u2013orinhibitory \u2013\nwhich means that they tend to keep the neuron from firing.\nA single neuron may have more than one set of dendrites, and may receive many \nthousands of input signals. \nWhether or not a neuron is excited into firing an impulse depends on the sum of \nall of the excitatory and inhibitory signals it receives.\nIf the neuron does end up firing, the nerve impulse is conducted down the axon.\n52How synapses work -Neurons are connected to each other at a location \ncalled a Synapse, so that they can communicate messages\nAmazingly, where each cell connects with the other one, NONE of \nthese cells ever touch each other !!\nThe signal that is carried from the first nerve fiber to the next one is \ntransmitted by an electrical signal or a chemical one, up to a speed \nof 268 miles per hour !\nThere is new evidence that both types closely interact with each other and \nthat the transmission of a nerve signal is both chemical andelectrical, \nwhich is actually required for normal brain development and function.\nhttps://www.youtu\nbe.com/watch?v=m\nItV4rC57kM&t=10s53\nIf you don\u2019t use a foreign language you learned years ago or \nmathematics, the neurons used for those things will move the \nsynapses away from each other so they can do other things that \nyou are learning to do.
